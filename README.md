# Artemis Lite
Artemis Lite is a virtual board game that is played via the console of the software development package (e.g. Eclipse).

It is a Monopoly style board game and has a distinctive theme, based on [NASA’s Artemis mission](https://nasa.gov/specials/artemis/) to land the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024.

Artemis Lite reflects in very much simplified form some of the challenges (e.g. technical, logistical, financial etc.) of the real lunar mission.

## Game Play
* The game has up to four players (representing different Space Organisations).
* Players take turns
  * They throw 2 virtual dice
  * Players are told where they have landed and what their obligations or opportunities are. Where appropriate, they may indicate their choice of action.
    * For example, by dedicating some of their resources, they may ‘take charge’ of a square no one else owns.
    * If a player lands on a square no one owns, but they don’t want to take charge of it themselves, it may be offered at the usual cost to another player.
    * If a player’s resources have changed, the system indicates the reason for the change and announces the player’s new ‘balance’.
* There is a start square, where players pick up their resources – this is the equivalent of a ‘Collect X as you pass Go’ square.
* There is a square where nothing happens.
* There are 4 ‘systems’, two consisting of three adjacent squares and two consisting of two adjacent squares.
  * One of the two-element systems is the most costly system to acquire and resource; another two-element system is the least costly system to acquire and resource.
* Before you can develop an element within a system, you must own the whole system.
* On your turn you can develop an element in a systemthat you already own, even if you are not currently positioned on that element.
* Unlike similar board games, with Artemis Lite you may, if you wish, develop one element fully before developing the others, and you may undertake more than one development per turn.
* Three ‘developments’ of an element are needed before you can complete (and pay for, or otherwise ‘resource’) the equivalent of a ‘major development’.
* Not only is there a cost associated with developing elements within systems: when you land on an element, but do not ‘own’ it yourself, you normally have to give up some of your resources for it – the more developed the element, the greater the resource that you are normally expected to give the owner.
  * However, in the interests of the greater good, the owner may decline to accept your offer of resources. Why would that be...?
    * Well, if one player runs out of resources during the gameplay, or if one player no longer wants to play, the game ends for all players.
    * Is the player without resources the loser, or have they heroically given their all in the noble cause of space exploration? You decide.
* On the other hand, if all the elements of all the systems are fully developed, Artemis is ready for launch: all systems are ‘go’ and the project is on the path to ultimate success!
  * It pays, in other words, to keep people in the game, let them acquire and develop systems,and together complete the mission!
* As soon as development is complete, the path ahead is announced: this is a summary of future events at the end of a movie (an epilogue).
* When the game ends, the final state of play is displayed.
